      <h1>Saen Kazak</h1>
<p>Saen is a Java programmer and game tinkerer with a keen interest in analysing interactions between humans and machine systems. Currently in their final year of a Computer Science undergraduate degree, Saen aspires to conduct research into system design optimization. Saen also has an interest in developing methods to utilize continuous mathematical functions in areas such as deep learning.<br>Saen has also been a Minecraft modder and scripter with over 11 years of experience stress-testing and pushing the game to its extreme limits. Through this, Saen has developed a vision to challenge the boundaries of mathematical reasoning within high-level simulations. They have developed multiple heuristic-based arcade style games inside the Minecraft engine to showcase creativity and out-of-the-box thinking.
In addition to their technical skills, Saen is a hobbyist music mixer with a focus on Eurobeat-style music. Saen believes that a creative and forward-thinking mindset is essential for success in this area. They are enthusiastic about leveraging their skills to create innovations that skew the boundaries of possibility.</p>

      <h3>Railmapper</h3>
      <p>Railmapper was a basic railway display application I created for my A-Level Computer Science Coursework in 2020. I've got a modified version of my assignment submission hosted here; this is mainly for current A-Level Computer Science students to view an example portfolio. The PDF can be viewed by clicking here.</p>

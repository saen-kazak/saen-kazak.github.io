      <h1>Saen Kazak</h1>
<p>
Saen is a Java programmer and data meddler with a keen interest in analysing the interactions between humans and computer systems. Currently in their final year of a Computer Science undergraduate degree, Saen aspires to conduct research into human-centered system design optimization. Saen greatly enjoy playing around with data and statistics to create cool looking charts and graphs, and also has specific interests in heuristic search models and the use of continuous mathematics in algorithmic optimization.
</p><p>Saen has been a Minecraft modder and scripter with over 11 years of experience stress-testing and pushing the game to its extreme limits. Through this, Saen has developed a vision to challenge the boundaries of mathematical reasoning within high-level simulations. They have developed multiple heuristic-based arcade style games inside the Minecraft engine to showcase creativity and out-of-the-box thinking.
</p><p>
In addition to their technical skills, Saen also enjoys being a terrible hobbyist 200-ish BPM extreme Eurobeat and Techno DJ. Saen believes that a creative and forward-thinking mindset is essential for success. They are enthusiastic about leveraging their skills to create innovations that skew the boundaries of possibility.

I like to make cool things with computers and show them off. Not all of my projects are Minecraft-related but whenever I do make something worthy of showing off, it will be in the list below! Feel free to have a look at some of the nonsense I get up in my free time.

      <p>I occasionally write articles about railways and you can find some of my thoughts here. I've mostly written about Crossrail and the Great Eastern Main Line, both in the UK.</p>

      <h3>Railmapper</h3>
      <p>Railmapper was a basic railway display application I created for my A-Level Computer Science Coursework in 2020. I've got a modified version of my assignment submission hosted here; this is mainly for current A-Level Computer Science students to view an example portfolio. The PDF can be viewed by clicking here.</p>

<p>In this scenario, the <strong>Usability Engineering Lifecycle</strong> is the most optimal design method to use. SSM would not be useful as this method is optimal for large complex projects. The grocery store, however, is a local business and is unlikely to have a wide variety of stakeholders with significantly different needs, making UE the best choice. The star lifecycle has a focus on evaluation which is likely not necessary for a solution of this nature. The UE lifecycle, on the other hand, is iterative, allowing feedback to be given at the end of each development cycle as opposed to a system where development stages are less ordinal.</p><p>

However, the design stage for UE allows for the creation of an initial conceptual design, which can then be evaluated against a framework in order to create the final design. This is useful as it allows for testing of the software in a way that is not needlessly complex for the problem at hand.</p><p>

Participatory design could also be considered, however, unlike certain settings where user input is critical to the design process, such as in healthcare, it is unlikely that stakeholder requirements for a grocery store application contain a level of complexity that necessitates significant input from end users during development.<br/><br/>

Tips:<br/>
Talk about the iterative nature of UE as an example of why it is effective<br/>
When making comparisons, such as with Participatory, use examples to emphasize your point

The best design method to use with this problem is <strong>Participatory Design</strong>. Participatory design allows for a project framework where feedback from users is prioritised. Since dieting may be a sensitive topic to some stakeholders, it is imperative that user feedback is taken to ensure the solution is optimised for the needs of these stakeholders.</p><p>

UE would not be suitable for this problem as there is simply not enough evaluation taking place during design and development to warrant its use. Soft Systems is also not optimal as the stakeholder range required for SSM to be effective is too large for this problem. The Star Lifecycle could also be considered. However, Star is less optimal due to the fact that the focus on evaluation seen in Star does not place such a heavy emphasis on users. Participatory Design takes feedback via the use of workshops, questionnaires, or other methods of communication where the end-users themselves are centralised. It builds on the notion that users are the experts and their input should be taken into consideration.</p><p>

Participatory design is specialised to cater to problems of this nature. Data extraction from focus groups of different stakeholders, such as those looking to lose a lot of weight, can be compared against data from other groups in order to create a solution that caters to all end-users effectively and equally. PD may also help increase user engagement and boost the user satisfaction as users are more likely to feel they are being catered to and cared for, with their concerns heard and understood, during the development process.</p>

<h2 id="visibility">Visibility</h2>
<p>It is important for users to be able to tell exactly what a user interface does simply by looking at it.</p>
<h2 id="feedback">Feedback</h2>
<p>Feedback should be provided on the status of an action after the action has occurred., such as informing the user that a login was successful or failed.</p>
<h2 id="affordance">Affordance</h2>
<p>The Affordance principle refers to how easy it is for a user to understand how something is used based on its appearance. For example, a user settings page would have high affordance if the user is aware of its capabilities and what can be achieved through its use.</p>
<h2 id="mapping">Mapping</h2>
<p>Mapping refers to how well the controls of a design resemble their effect. For example, an arrow telling the user to swipe down would be a good example if it moves the page down.</p>
<h2 id="constraints">Constraints</h2>
<p>Essentially <strong>validation</strong>. Inputs should be constrained to stop incorrect values from being entered.</p>
<h2 id="consistency">Consistency</h2>
<p>The elements of a design should be similar in appearance to minimise confusion. For example, if a webpage uses a specific font style for normal text, this font style should be consistent across the whole web page.</p>
